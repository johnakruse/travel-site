This is a travel website I am building. The idea is that you can get a list of points on the areas you're interested in and plan out each day by adding these to a list and calculating things like how long you'll spend in each place, how long travel will take, etc. It's very much a work in progress but I display it here to show other people.

I have this repo here in order to show off my work and possibly help inspire other developers, however I don't give any license to use this work in commercial products without my express permission.
